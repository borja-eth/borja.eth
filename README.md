Fun Facts:

# Met #BTC when at age 14. Used to mine #BTC at that age, and yes, I formatted many of those HDDs,
**I was a gamer and couldn't afford to buy new ones.
**# #BTC and #ETH fan, can't hold any other crypto (Although I love DeFi and Uniswap).
# Recently got into NFTs and huge fan of them.
# Couldn't afford to buy a Crypto Punk so the closest thing I could get was a Baby Crypto Punk.
# Lemon almost dies, and after it, we took it to the big leagues.
# Love to read, love to work.
# Kitesurf, surf and snowboard when seeking for peace.
# Raised in the countryside.

`Don't let anybody tell you it's impossible.`
